# USTC-NERCSLIP_CHiME-8_NOTSOFAR-1_System

The USTC-NERCSLIP CHiME-7 & CHiME-8 setup is too complex to consolidate into a single repository. Weâ€™ve therefore extracted several submodules for independent updates, and will ultimately assemble our final system by combining these submodules. The current sub-repositories are as follows:

- [jsalt2020_simulate_modified](https://github.com/rywang99/jsalt2020_simulate_modified)
- [cacgmm_refinement](https://github.com/rywang99/cacgmm_refinement)
